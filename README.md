# Javascript Calculator

I saw this calculator design on YouTube and decided to create something similar with several improvements to the JavaScript that controls the calculator's functions.

The script.js file was completely written by me.

The style.scss file is a SCSS version of the CSS code in the video linked below (with some alterations regarding the backspace and negative (+/-) buttons, which aren't present in the video).

The style.min.css file is just the style.scss file compiled to minified CSS

The vanilla-tilt.min.js file was downloaded from micku7zu's GitHub, link to the project can be founded below.
